# EDA-smartphones
This project conducts a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a dataset of smartphones. The goal is to uncover patterns and insights that could help explain the relationship between the smartphone features (like price, brand, storage, etc.) and the user ratings. Insights are drawn from different visualizations and statistical tests, which highlight key factors influencing the ratings.

## Data Analysis Steps

1. **Primary Analysis**: 
   - Handling missing values.
   - Understanding of data types, amount of data, duplicates
  
2. **Univariate analysis**:
   - Basic statistics like mean, median, mode, and standard deviation etc.
   - Distribution of numerical variables.
   - Distribution of categorical variables.

3. **Multivariates analysis**:
   - Correlation heatmaps to identify relationships between numeric features.

4. **Statistical Testing**:
   - Hypothesis testing to determine the significance of factors (e.g., does price affect ratings?).
   - ANOVA tests and t-tests to compare ratings across different categories.


## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
